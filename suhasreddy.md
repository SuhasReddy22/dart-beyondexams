# All about Dart

Dart is an open-source object-oriented programming language with c-style syntax which was developed by **Google in 2011**

It is Focused on **frontend**(mobile,web apps) **user interface**(UI) development. 

void main(){
    for(int i=0; i<5; i++){
        print('hellow ${i + 1}');
    }
}

# Benefits of Dart

* Use of async and awit for asynchronous programming.

* Dart is one of very few languages(and perhaps the only "mainstream" language) that is well suited to being complied both **AOT(ahead-of-time)** and **JIT(just-in-time)**. Supporting both kinds of compliation provides significant advantages to Dart and (especialy) Flutter (**Hot Reload Feature**)

* JIT compilation is used during development, using a complier that is especially fast

* Extremely fast development cycles, and fast execution and startup times

* Flutter doesnt split layout between your program and an additional templating or layout language like JSM or XML, nor does it require separate visual layout tools
